# Let-it-snow
Repository containing project files for the "The Secret Of AAA Snow Shaders" YouTube video.
This repository provides a cleaned up shader graphs of the source shaders from the "Surface Gradient Bump Mapping Samples" package made by Unity.
The graphs are cleaned from containing various branches and options that made the original shaders more generic. This way the shaders are made specifically for creating snow covered surfaces.
